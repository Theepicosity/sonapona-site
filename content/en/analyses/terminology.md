# Complexity Alignment

## Hausic
Sentences tend to compound and feature long, ambiguous phrases that need more effort to parse than lilic-aligned sentences. Context is often not shared between sentences.
> tenpo pini la lon tomo mi la jan li moli tan kuntu li pakala e linwuli sina.
kulupu Discord "ma pona pi toki pona" la tenpo suno tu kama la kulpu toki uta en kulupu toki sitelen li lon kulupu Discord.

## Lilic
Sentences tend to be small and easy to parse, and share a lot of context between them.
mi jo e soweli. soweli li pimeja. soweli li suli. ona li suwi. ona li pakala e tomo mi. taso mi pona. 

## Pelac
Sentences tend to be larger and feature light compounding, but not as much compounding as Hausic sentences, while context is shared between Pelac sentences, often explicitly with pronouns or ni-statements.
tomo mi la mi pali tan ni: mi wile lape lon tomo pona.
