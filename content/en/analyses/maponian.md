# Overview

Maponian is one of the larger dialects of toki pona. Maponian is largely
characterised by two things:

1) Maponian is mostly taught through #pana-sona by a somewhat homogeneous speaker
base that generally doesn't have conflicts when trying to communicate through
toki pona, resulting in a fairly standardised dialect of toki pona that incubates
new speakers fast.

2) Maponian has a faster than normal cycle of evolution due to the #sona-musi
channel encouraging sharing and discussion of ideas that would otherwise wither
on the vine or get shunned by the community.

# Notable Non-pu vocabulary

## tonsi

genderqueer, trans, not cis

## linluwi

connection, network, relationship

## kuntu

laughter
